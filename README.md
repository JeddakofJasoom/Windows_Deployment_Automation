Answer files to automate worsktation deployment for Windows 10 and 11 operating systems in a professional setting. 

-- Currently this is set for my use only, until I'm confident that I have functioning scripts to be used publicly. You will see functional scripts in the "main" branch and will have a note in the file name indicating so.

-- Please feel free to request pulls from this repository for your own tinkering.

*** NO confidential information is listed in any scripts listed on this repository, ever.***
