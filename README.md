# Windows_Deployment_Automation
Scripts and answer files to automate workstation deployment for Windows 10 and 11 operating systems in a professional setting. 

Currently this is set for my use only, until I'm confident that I have functioning scripts to be used publicly. You will see functional scripts in the "main" branch and will have a note in the file name indicating so. 

I do my best to retain sources for scripts. If I borrow someone else's script without source attribution, it is completely unintentional. 

*** NO confidential information is listed in any scripts listed on this repository, ever.***
